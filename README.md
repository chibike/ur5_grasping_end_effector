# ur5_grasping_end_effector
The goal of this project was to design, make and test an end effector for the UR5 robot that will be used to grasp and pick up a transparent plastic cup filled with water and empty this water into a plastic bath. The end effector was also required to detect the presence of water in the transparent plastic cup and feed this information to a LabVIEW control program.
